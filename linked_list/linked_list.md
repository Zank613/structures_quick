# Linked List

- A linear data structure where elements, often called nodes, are stored in series.
  Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have contigous memory allocation. Each node
  contains data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

- Linked lists can grow or shrink in size dynamically.

- Operations can be done easily at any position in the list.

- There are several types of linked lists, however I'll add Singly Linked List only.
    - Traversal for this forward only.
    - Each node points to the next node.
