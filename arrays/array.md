# Arrays

- Arrays are very straightforward data structures used in C, a collection of elements of the same memory size.
- Most simple one is a one-dimensional array, you can go up to however many more dimensions you like.
- Arrays can be accessed through indexing.
- You can define the size of array, or you can make it sized at compile time.
- There are also VLAs (Variable Length Arrays) in C99, you can define the size at runtime.
