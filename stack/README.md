# Stack

- Stack is an ADT (abstract data type) basically an array with two main operations:
    - Push, adds an element to the collection.
    - Pop, removes recently added element.

- You can think stack as basically a stack of plates, you can't get something from middle, only from top.

- So you can't remove from middle of the stack nor add it there. Only operation is allowed at the top.

- Stack is also described as LIFO (Last in, first out).

- Stacks are perfect for situations where you need to keep track of history or need to reverse operations,
  such as parsing expression or managing functions calls.
